Prefer typescript over javascript.

Prefer async/await syntax over .then()/.catch()

Prefer using the `function` keyword to define functions rather than using arrow functions or `const` function expressions.

Prefer `Array.forEach` over `for of`.

Prefer optional chaining (e.g., `registration?.sync`) over using logical AND (`registration && registration.sync`) inside conditional statements.

Always destruct the "props" object inside the function body, never in the function's signature.

All imports need to be relative as this project doesn't support absolute paths.

Avoid returning the output of a function directly as the input to another function. Always store the output in a variable first before passing it to another function.
